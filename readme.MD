# Legacy: Use [Math3d-React](https://github.com/ChristopherChudzicki/math3d-react) instead

This repo is no longer maintained. Use [Math3d-React](https://github.com/ChristopherChudzicki/math3d-react) instead, a total rewrite of the Math3d project using React.

[Math3d-React](https://github.com/ChristopherChudzicki/math3d-react) now powers [math3d.org](https://www.math3d.org).

### Math3d 

[math3d.org](https://www.math3d.org) is a 3d graphing calculator in your web browser. Create, animate, and share visualizations of 3d mathematics.
